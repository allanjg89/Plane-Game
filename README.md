# Plane-Game
Plane Game Project

2 Dimensional, 2 Player. Players faced randomly generated enemy planes with varying behavior. Appearance of particular type of plane influenced by timeline. Designed/implemented all classes and hierarchy. Designed and implemented all desired effects.
Implemented in JAVA with Observer pattern on Eclipse IDE.
The observer pattern allowed clear method definition within classes and reduced redundancy of event checking.
Observers were tuned to key input and collision events
Extensive use of abstract methods, polymorphism, method overloading, composition, and singleton.
Extended JApplet and implemented Runnable
Runnable allowed for seamless player experience by reducing lag between events.
